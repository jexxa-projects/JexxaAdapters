# Jexxa Adapters

This project contains common technology adapters 
used by the [Jexxa](https://www.jexxa.io) and [JLegMed](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JLegMed) framework. 
These adapters are based on typical microservices and messaging patterns to simplify implementing microservices. 

* `adapter-api`: This library provides a unified API for using adapters and is used by all following libraries 
* `common-adapters`: This library provides the following microservice and messaging patterns: 
  * [Repository](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html) that isolates the data layer from the rest of the app on object/entity level 
  * [Transactional Outbox Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html) to atomically update the database and send messages to a message broker when 2FC is not an option
  * [Idempotent Consumer](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/idempotent-consumer.html) to handle duplicate messages correctly
  * Facade to Java JDBC and JMS API to simplify the implementation of additional adapters
